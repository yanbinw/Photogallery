      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Yanbin Wu, and I am a college student studying Computer
        Engineering at UMass Amherst. I am passionate about photography and have
        been capturing moments through my lens for the past 2 years. My
        photography journey began when my dad first hand me his Nikon D5100.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in portrait, landscape. My goal is to tell stories through
        my photographs, capturing emotions and moments that resonate with
        people.
